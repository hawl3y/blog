# Hello, World!

In the spirit of every programmer's first program, this is my official "Hello, World!" post.

With more than two decades in MedTech, starting as a self-taught coder and advancing through web development, technical analysis, and business partnerships, I now direct enterprise cybersecurity programs at a Fortune 500 company.

This space will showcase:

- **Portfolio** – Key projects and achievements, including my gamified cybersecurity awareness app, Trusty Potato.
- **Blog** – Insights on cybersecurity leadership, MedTech security challenges, emerging threats, neurodiversity in tech, and practical lessons from bridging security with business value.
- **About** – More on my journey, approach, and why I see security as a strategic enabler that makes the secure path the easiest one.

As a neurodivergent leader, I bring a unique lens to partnering with business teams: aligning security priorities, providing risk-based guidance that translates threats into actionable business insights, advocating for user needs in security decisions, and enabling resilient growth through simple, scalable processes.

In my role leading a Security Partnership team, we focus on collaboration over control, delivering awareness campaigns, role-based training, tabletop exercises, and feedback-driven improvements to foster informed risk-taking and maintain digital trust.

Expect posts diving into:

- Measuring security success through adoption, readiness, and engagement metrics
- Personal tools and experiments I build along the way
- Lessons from my travels to Japan and how cultural perspectives shape cybersecurity thinking
- Life with my miniature dachshund, Daisy, and balancing leadership with personal passions

Thanks for stopping by.

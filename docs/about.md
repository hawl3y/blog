**Fortune 500 Director | CISSP**

_Pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute of Technology._

As a neurodivergent leader in cybersecurity, I bring focused intensity, empathy, and precision to bridging security with business needs. I partner with executives to guide risk-informed decisions that protect what matters most while making the secure path the easiest one.

With over two decades in MedTech, I've evolved from programming and web development to technical analysis and strategic partnerships. Today, I direct enterprise security programs that enable growth without unnecessary risk.

Raised in North Carolina and now based in New York, I mentor emerging professionals and advocate for neurodiversity in tech. Outside of work, I cherish time with my wonderful wife, a talented singer-songwriter, our miniature dachshund Daisy, and my son, an electrician back in NC.

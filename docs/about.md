**Fortune 500 Director | CISSP**

_Pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute of Technology._

As a neurodivergent leader in cybersecurity, I bring focused intensity, empathy, and precision to bridging security with business value. I partner with executives to guide risk-informed decisions that protect what matters most while making the secure path the easiest one.

My career spans over two decades in MedTech, evolving from programming and web development through technical analysis and business partnerships to directing enterprise security programs that enable growth without unnecessary risk.

Raised in North Carolina and now living in New York, I mentor emerging professionals, advocate for neurodiversity in tech, and enjoy time with my beautiful wife, a singer-songwriter, our miniature dachshund Daisy, and staying connected with my son, an electrician back in NC.
